# dreamberd-array
An actual implementation of the DreamBerd array in rust.

## Specification
The entirety of the specification can be found [here](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd?tab=readme-ov-file#arrays).

In simple terms:

- Indexing starts at -1
- Floats are valid Indexes

## Thanks
Inspired by [DreamBerd](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd).

The underlying array is a singly linked list, build using the awesome Book: [Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/second-final.html).
